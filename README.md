# Peace of Mind

![Responsive site preview](assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

Discover a calming, beginner-friendly resource dedicated to mental health awareness. This website offers clear explanations, supportive guidance, and practical tools to help you understand common mental health topics, manage stress, and find helpful resources—all in a soothing, accessible environment.

---

## Goal

The goal of this website is to provide **accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health**. It aims to help users recognize common mental health issues and manage stress, all presented in a supportive and organized layout.

---

## AI-Assisted User Story Generation

To streamline the planning process, I used **ChatGPT** to generate several user stories. After reviewing and refining these stories to fit the project scope, I also used ChatGPT to generate acceptance criteria and tasks for each story. This approach significantly reduced the time required to develop user stories, criteria, and tasks.

All user stories were added to the GitHub project board and organized using **"must have," "should have," and "could have"** labels for clarity and prioritization.

---

## AI Palette Verification

I used ChatGPT to check if the color palette I created for the design of the page fit a calm and relaxing feel that is user friendly. This was the outcome of that question:

> **Here's a quick breakdown of the colors from your Coolors link:**
>
> -   `#F1E0C5` – a warm, creamy beige
> -   `#C9B79C` – a soft, muted taupe
> -   `#7B6D8D` – a dusty lavender/gray-purple
> -   `#342A21` – a deep, earthy brown
> -   `#BEA7E5` – a gentle, pastel lilac
>
> **Does it invoke a calm feel?**
>
> Yes, it does. Here's why:
>
> -   **Muted tones:** None of the colors are overly saturated, which contributes to a sense of tranquility and softness.
> -   **Warm neutrals** (`#F1E0C5`, `#C9B79C`, `#342A21`): These earthy tones ground the palette and evoke comfort and calm.
> -   **Soft purples** (`#7B6D8D`, `#BEA7E5`): Purples, especially in dusty or pastel tones, tend to feel introspective, serene, and slightly dreamy.
>
> **Overall Vibe:**  
> This palette feels like a quiet moment at dusk—warm light fading into cool shadows. It could easily be used for themes of reflection, gentle fantasy, nostalgia, or cozy minimalism.

## Image Creation and Integration

To maintain a cohesive and calming visual theme, I used GitHub Copilot’s AI-powered image generation to create a set of custom images for the website. This ensured that all visuals consistently reflect the site’s purpose—promoting mental health awareness in a supportive and soothing manner.

Each image was designed to complement the chosen color palette, emphasizing soft, tranquil tones that align with the overall aesthetic. This approach helps unify the site’s imagery, layout, and colors, resulting in a harmonious and inviting user experience. The custom images not only enhance visual appeal but also reinforce the site’s message of calm, clarity, and encouragement.

### Custom Images Created

Additionally, each carousel background was custom-generated to match the site’s theme, such as:

### Wireframes

Based on the user stories generated with ChatGPT, I designed wireframes for the site, starting with a **mobile-friendly layout**:

![Mobile wireframe preview](assets/images/mobileversion.png)

Afterwards, I quickly created a **desktop (web) version** of the wireframe:

![Desktop wireframe preview](assets/images/webpageversion.png)

As the development progressed, some design elements evolved beyond the initial wireframes. To ensure the wireframes accurately reflected the updated look and feel of the site, I revised them to match the emerging design direction. Below are the updated wireframes, which incorporate these adjustments:

## Code Validation

After completing the minimum viable product, I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the HTML code for errors. The initial validation revealed several issues, as shown below:

![Validation errors screenshot](assets/images/error%20during%20validation.png)

I promptly addressed these errors and revalidated the code. The updated validation confirmed that all issues had been resolved:

![Passing validation screenshot](assets/images/passing%20validation.png)

## CSS Validation

After ensuring the HTML was error-free, I also validated the site’s CSS using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The results confirmed that the stylesheet passed without any errors or warnings:

![Passing CSS validation screenshot](assets/images/Screenshot%202025-05-31%20130944.png)

This validation helps guarantee that the site’s styles are standards-compliant and should render consistently across modern browsers.

## Lighthouse Performance Audit

After compressing all images in the project to optimize loading times, I used Google Chrome DevTools to run a **Lighthouse audit** on the deployed site. Lighthouse evaluates key aspects such as performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Below is the resulting score:

![Lighthouse score screenshot](assets/images/lighthouse%20score.png)

This high score demonstrates that the site is well-optimized, accessible, and follows web development best practices.

## Known Issues

-   On mobile and tablet devices, after selecting an item from the dropdown menu, the menu does not automatically close. This causes it to remain open and cover the section title, resulting in a UI issue.

    ### Solution

    To address this issue, I consulted GitHub Copilot for suggestions and confirmed that the problem could be resolved with a small JavaScript snippet. By adding this script, the dropdown menu now automatically closes after a selection is made, resulting in a smoother and more user-friendly experience.

## Roadmap

### Planned Improvements

-   **Add more mental health topics:**  
     Expand the site’s content to cover additional mental health conditions and topics, such as eating disorders, bipolar disorder, OCD, and coping strategies for various life situations. This will provide users with a broader range of information and support.

-   **Expand resource links:**  
     Curate and include more links to reputable mental health organizations, hotlines, and online resources. This will help users find further support, self-help tools, and professional assistance relevant to their needs.

-   **Add language/localization support:**  
     Implement multilingual options so users can access the site in different languages. This will make the information more accessible to a diverse, global audience.

-   **Add a self-check form page:**  
     Create an interactive self-assessment form to help users reflect on their mental health and recognize potential concerns. The form will provide gentle feedback.

-   **Add a gentle relaxing music player:**  
     Integrate a built-in music player featuring calming, royalty-free tracks. This feature aims to enhance the site’s soothing atmosphere and offer users a way to relax while browsing.
